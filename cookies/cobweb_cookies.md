##Cobweb Cookies

#Ingredients
¾ cup all-purpose flour
½ cup granulated sugar
¼ cup vegetable oil
¼ cup milk
½ tsp vanilla
2 eggs
Powdered sugar

#Cooking Directions
1. Beat all ingredients except powdered sugar in a medium bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Pour batter into plastic squeeze bottle with narrow opening. Heat 8-inch skillet over medium heat until hot; grease lightly.
2. Working quickly, squeeze batter to form 4 straight, thin lines that intersect at a common center point to form a star shape. To form cobweb, squeeze thin streams of batter to connect lines.

4. Heat oven to 325℉. Bake cookies on ungreased cookie sheet 5-7 minutes or until almost crisp (cookies will become crisp as they cool.) remove from cookie sheet; cool. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Store cookies in container with loose-fitting cover.
