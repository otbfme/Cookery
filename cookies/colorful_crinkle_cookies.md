##Colorful Crinkle Cookies

Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:  60 minutes
Makes: 6 dozen cookies

#Ingredients
- ¾ cup confectioners’ sugar
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 2 boxes (18.25 oz. each) French Vanilla cake mix
- 4 large eggs
- ¾ cup (12 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- ½ tsp red food coloring
- ½ tsp green food coloring

#Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and cornstarch; set aside.
3. In large bowl combine the cake mixes, eggs, and melted butter. Beat with an electric mixer until thick and well blended.
4. Divide the batter into thirds. Stir the red food coloring into one third and the green into another third. Leave one third white. Working with one color of batter at a time, divide each into 24 balls about 1 ½” across. Rolls the balls in the confectioner's sugar mixture to coat. Transfer to a prepared cookie sheet; repeat with the remaining batter, placing balls about 2” apart.
5. Bake until the cookies are puffed and lightly browned around the edges, 9-10 minutes. Let cool several minutes before transferring the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough.
